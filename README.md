# SFPic â€” easy and secure way to share files

SFPic is a web application built with React and NestJS and backed by CouchDB.

## Getting Started

__Live Demo is available at:__

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

An installation of NodeJS at least v10.16.3 and CouchDB v2.3.1 is required before proceeding to installing the web app.

Make sure following commands are executing correctly with similar output.

```
$ node -v
v10.16.3

$ yarn -v
1.21.1

$ curl http://127.0.0.1:5984
{"couchdb":"Welcome","version":"2.3.1"}
```

To get instructions on how to install software mentioned above hit following links for [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [CouchDB](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/install/index.html).

_Alternatively you may want to use the [PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com) instead of CouchDB as a data storage for the app. However, if you thinking about that you probably don't require instructions._

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Checkout the repository.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:askhat/sfpic.git
$ cd sfpic
```

Install JavaScript dependencies.

```
# recommended
$ yarn

# or
$ npm install
```

Finally run the web app and its backend in a separate terminal.

```
$ yarn run web
# new window
$ yarn run backend
```

If everything has been set correctly navigate to [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) to see the app in action.
